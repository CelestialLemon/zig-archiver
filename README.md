zig-archiver is a archiver built using zig a programming language I've been trying to learn recently. This is my first real project is Zig.

Scope for project:

1. Archiver can compress files and directories into a single file (.zar) 
2. Archiver can take the single compressed file and produce the original files and directory from it. 
3. Archiver can have different levels of compression
4. Archiver compares hashes for the input data during compression and decompression to make sure that the data is not corrupt.
